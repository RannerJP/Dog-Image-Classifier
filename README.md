# Dog Image Classifer

This is a python project for classifying 10 different dog breeds.
This project has been trained on the [Stanford Dogs dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). 
The whole dataset is not used, just 10 breeds I believed to be distinct enough from each other:
- Borzoi
- Chihuahua
- Dingo
- German Shepherd
- Golden Retriever
- Mexican Hairless
- Pug
- Shih-Tzu
- Siberian Husky
- Standard Poodle
